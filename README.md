## Blog Application with React and Node.js

An application created during the FullstackOpen course.

This is a simple blog application implemented using React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. The application allows users to read blogs, add their own blogs, and give them likes.

## Features

   - User interface built with React.
   - Backend functionality with Node.js and Express.js.
   - User management with JWT tokens.
   - Sorting blogs in descending order based on the number of likes.
   - Users can add new blogs and give them likes.
   - Login and logout functionality.
   - Tests implemented with Jest.

## Technologies

  - Frontend: React, React Hooks, Context API.
  - Backend: Node.js, Express.js.
  - Database: MongoDB

## What Did I Learn?

I learned the core features of React, such as state management using useState hooks and sharing state between different components using the Context API. Additionally, I practiced the interaction between the frontend and backend, implementing requests to the backend.

I also gained knowledge in error handling across different parts of the application, such as user login, blog creation, and updates. The project's structure and organization of components are now clear and maintainable. I delved into user management, covering registration, login, and the use of JWT tokens for managing user sessions.

Overall, this project provided me with a comprehensive understanding of React and Node.js fundamentals, strengthening my knowledge of web development and offering practical experience in building applications.
